# Extracting Statistic from Source Code

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* Computational concerns of creating graphs from Smali
* Using graph statistics as features (and using these for EDA).

## Reading

Please read the following:
* (Re)Read [HinDroid](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/papers/2017-KDD-HINDROID.pdf)
  sections 3.1 - 3.2 (Features & HIN construction).
* From the `/teams/DSC180A_FA20/a04malware` directory, run the command
  `ls -l malware/ | shuf | head -3`. This will pull 3 Malware types at
  random. Google them and try to find out what they do.

Bonus:

* Read [MaMaDroid](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04433.pdf) (Sections I,
  IIABC). This paper uses something closer to an n-gram approach to
  source code in the same setting.

## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:
* Continue work on the ETL pipeline (work on the larger dataset)
* Complete an EDA on (a sample of) the app dataset in the `/teams`
  directory. You should be aiming to answer questions:
  - how do the apps differ for Malware vs Not? Different types of
    Malware? Random vs. Popular apps?
  - which classes in an app 'add no new information'? How might you
    extract data from a subset of the smali files in an app?
* From the EDA, you've likely computed a table where the observations
  are apps and the columns are statistics for that app. Use this to
  train/test a baseline classifier (e.g. using Logistic
  Regression). This will serve as a basis for later comparison.

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Canvas:
* Give a summary of a Malware type in the training data that you
  researched. What does it do? How does it work?
* Give an interesting observation from your EDA. Be specific, with
  precise values!
* What features did you use in your baseline model? What was the model performance?
* What difficulties did you encounter that you would like to discuss
  this week?
